# simulation-stock-trajectory-

Welcome to my mini project on stock price simulation using Monte Carlos simulation. In this project I used Alpacas API to fetch market data and saved it to a pandas dataframe. I then cleaned up the data and calculated the percentage daily change, which i saved in a new dataframe.

You can find my code with comments in the file labelled _stock_price_simulation.ipynb_.
